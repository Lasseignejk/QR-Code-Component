## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project took me much less time than my first, and I was able to re-use some of the code from that project. I think I'm slowly getting more comfortable with Flexbox. 

I think the big thing I learned this time around was how to put the attribution at the bottom of the page; I looked everywhere on the internet for a way to do it with Flexbox, only to find out that it is simply adding a position and then bottom. I'll make sure to remember that for the future. 

I also messed around with a shadow which was fun! It was a little difficult to get the hang of, and I definitely spent a lot of time messing with it to get it where I wanted, but I'm glad I did it. 

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable finding answers on the internet. Right now, it takes me a long time to search for what I think are simple problems -- I'm not always sure what I should type in to Google to pull up the solutions I'm looking for. Hopefully that'll become easier with time.
